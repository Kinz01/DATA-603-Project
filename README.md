## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

This report looks at how oil production, rental housing, and employment have changed across Alberta. By analyzing municipal-level data, we aim to provide a clear picture of the economic trends shaping munipalities throughout the province.

Our goals are to:

* Analyze oil and natural gas production across Alberta municipalities.
* Examine rental price trends within those regions.
* Explore employment patterns by municipality.
* Analyze oil and natural price trends across key years and Alberta Municipalities.

# Guiding Questions <a id="questions"></a>

1. How have oil and natural gas production levels varied across municipalities and over time?
   
2. How do well counts differ across municipalities and time periods?

3. What are the trends in rental prices across municipalities?
   
4. What is the relationship between rental rates and employment rates (for both genders) in the top 5 municipalities with the highest rents during census years from 2001 to 2021?

5. How have oil revenues and natural gas revenues varied accross municipalities?

# Packages <a id="packages"></a>

**1.  Pandas**​

Pandas Python library offering flexible data structures like DataFrames and Series for efficient data manipulation and analysis. It simplifies tasks such as cleaning, transforming, merging, and visualizing structured data​

​

**2.  Matplotlib​**

Matplotlib is a Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It offers a comprehensive API that simplifies the process of generating various types of plots and charts for effective data presentation​

​

**3.  Seaborn**​

Seaborn is a Python visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics​

​

**4.  SQLAlchemy**​

SQLAlchemy is a Python library for working with databases. It lets you use Python code to create tables, manage connections, and write queries instead of using raw SQL. It supports many database systems and helps keep database tasks clear and organized.


# Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of trends across the municipalities within Alberta. We analyzed datasets for oil production, natural gas production, well count, employment rate, rental data, oil prices, and natural gas prices over the years 2003–2023. Some of the results we found were:

* There was a steady increase in oil production from 2003 to 2012, followed by a sharp upward trend from 2012 to 2013, which likely occurred due to improvements in in-situ techniques. Although there were dips in production during the oil crash from 2014 to 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, oil production has continued to rise.

* Natural gas production steadily decreased from 2007 to 2012, but began to rise again from 2014 to 2018, particularly in Greenview No. 16 due to the development of the Montney Formation.

* Well counts declined overall from 2003 to 2023, with noticeable dips during major downturns. However, oil and gas production continued to increase, suggesting that newer wells became more productive. This is likely due to advancements in drilling technology such as horizontal drilling and the use of Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques like waterflooding and polymer flooding.

* Municipalities like Wood Buffalo generated the highest oil revenues, while Greenview No. 16 and Yellowhead County led in natural gas revenues.

* Housing data shows that total rent across all municipalities steadily increased until 2019, dropped during the pandemic, and recovered in the following years.

* Looking at rental types, we observed an even distribution across all municipalities. Employment declined between 2016 and 2021, with the oil crash and COVID-19 being major contributing factors.

Overall, Alberta’s energy sector has become more efficient, with production increasing despite fewer wells being drilled. This project is useful for someone who may be looking for employment in the energy industry. By identifying municipalities with higher production and analyzing trends in rental data and resource revenue, an individual may be able to identify a high-producing area and determine whether relocating to that municipality would be beneficial for their career.
